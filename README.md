## ðŸ’ª Challenges and Solutions

Understanding the project's architecture: this was my first experience working on a project of this scale. 
It was challenging to bring all the elements together, grasp the connections between them, 
and integrate them effectively. However, through persistent effort, extensive research, 
and consultations with experienced professionals, I was able to develop an appropriate structure. 
Additionally, working with Spring Security was a particularly tough challenge. Despite its complexity, 
I managed to understand its configuration for application integration. 
Although it was difficult, I must admit that creating this project was an incredibly rewarding experience. 
I'm looking forward to further opportunities to practice and refine my skills.
